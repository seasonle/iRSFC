iRSFC
=====

iRSFC is the intuitive resting state functional connectivity toolbox.
You can analyze resting state functional MRI data to get functional connectivities
(i.e., seed-based connectivity analysis and compute adjacency matrix).
Also, you can get low-frequency fluctuation from rs-fMRI data.


Update log:

Ver 2.0 (Mar. 4, 2016):
Added dynamic FC analysis scheme.

Ver 1.0 (Jan. 7, 2016):
Added spm12 compapatibility.
Now, iRSFC is working with both spm8 and spm12.
